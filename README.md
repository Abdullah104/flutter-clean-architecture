# Flutter Clean Architecture 

## Flutter app implemented using Reso Coder Clean Architecture Proposal

# This implementation features null-safety, and upgraded versions, such as BLoC, and for null-safety, uses internet_connection_checker instead of data_connection_checker, and mocktail instead of mockito.

# I hope this repository helps anyone looking for a reference to sound-null safe clean architecture and test driven development implementation of flutter apps, and I will try to keep it up-to date and will track & accept pull requests from the community to this repository.
